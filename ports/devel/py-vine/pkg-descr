Python Promises.
If you run a server that serves multiple clients, or do heavy scientific 
calculations, there is no escaping them Currently there are two ways to go 
about it : Synchronous and Asynchronous programming.
The Promise is a design pattern that allow you to write asynchronous code in 
a "synchronous" manner. instead passing callbacks around you can simply chain 
the calls thus greatly simplyfying the logic flow of the code.
