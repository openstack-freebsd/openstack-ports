Eventlet is a networking library written in Python. It achieves high scalability
by using non-blocking IO while at the same time retaining high programmer
usability by using coroutines to make the non-blocking IO operations appear
blocking at the source code level.

notice: py-eventlet 0.21 does not work py-monotonic.
